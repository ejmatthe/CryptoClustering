# CryptoClustering
The goal was to review data about crypto-coin value changes, using unsupervised learning methods. There were ultimately two major approaches - one based on the full set of features, and another based on 3 features using PCA. Each approach involved using the data to find the best value for "k" for the K-Means model by plotting the inertia follows and looking for the elbow in the plot. This value is where the last, noticeable "bend" is - at this point, each additional step stops adding value. The K-Means model was initialized with the number of clusters set to the best value found in the previous step. This assigns a cluster "group" to each row in the DataFrame. A scatter plot was created to show the relationship between "24 Hour Price Change Percentage" and "7 Day Price Change Percentage" for the original data, and the first 2 principal components for the PCA-based model. Each point is colored based on the cluster "group", with the goal being each cluster as separated as possible from the others.

There are a few additional questions that are answered in the Jupyter Notebook code.
